# Getting Started with Create React App

  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

## Punk API

This project was created using the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/)


## About
This website fetches all beers from the Punk API and then displays them to the user to allow for them to be searched through. 

The user can search the beers by name and change the display order and how many results are shown. They can also use various filters to change what results are shown.
Current filters are:

 - If it is acidic (pH<4)
 - If it is in the Classic Range (brewed before 2010)
 - Specifying an ABV range

Each beer card can also be clicked on to show more information on a new page.
