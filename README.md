## Punk API

## About
This website fetches all beers from the Punk API and then displays them to the user to allow for them to be searched through. 

The user can search the beers by name and change the display order and how many results are shown. They can also use various filters to change what results are shown.
Current filters are:

 - If it is acidic (pH<4)
 - If it is in the Classic Range (brewed before 2010)
 - Specifying an ABV range

Each beer card can also be clicked on to show more information on a new page.
On this page the user can show the recipe for the beer.

Website is built mobile first and is responsive to changes in screen size
